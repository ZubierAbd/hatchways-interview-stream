# Hatchways - Interview Training Track

Below is the guide for acing the interview with Hatchways.

## Behavioural Interview Prep

The first step of practice is improving your ability to answer behaviour questions. This [link](./STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf) is a great resource for learning an effective approach to these types of questions. Please read this document thoroughly. 

Secondly, we would like you to use the method above to write out the answers to the following questions:

1. Tell me about yourself
2. What are your strengths?
3. What are your weaknesses?
4. Why are you interested in working here? For a startup? In technology?
5. Tell me about a time you solved a difficult problem 
6. Tell me about a time you worked in a team and the challenges you faced and how you solved them
7. Tell me about an accomplishment you are proud of 
8. Tell me about a project you recently worked on 
9. Tell me about something you recently learned 
10. Tell me how you got into this field and why you liked it 
11. Tell me what you're career goals are for the next 3-5 years 
12. Do you have any questions for me?
